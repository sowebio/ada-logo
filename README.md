# An Ada logo

## Introduction

**Back to the origins**, to promote a **revamped vintage logo**, in reference to the Ada logo of the AJPO (Ada Joint Program Office).

Like NASA **returned to its original logo** from the 60s, or BMW which has **always kept the propeller** in Bavarian colors, **too many logos kills the logo**. 

The **substance of a good logo is immutable**, even if the form can subtly evolve.

Ada is the **green language**, in reference to its identification color during the international competition, but also to express the energetic frugality of a compiled language vs. an interpreted language: the logo must be green.

The word **Ada must appear** in the logo.

The logo must be **simple enough** and offer **enough contrast** to be iconifiable.

The logo must express the essence of the language: the planet is the message of the **universality of Ada**.
